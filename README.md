Possible uses for DATE mostly lie in the scouting and GM department, and it is a useful metric to consider alongside standard tackle percentage/volume.
A player with high DATE and high tackle volume or percentage obviously suggests an elite player, but high DATE and low tackle volume suggests an underutilized (and thus undervalued) player.
High DATE and low tackle percentage suggests an unusually high level of opponent which may be unfairly negatively impacting his tackle percentage, and thus a potentially undervalued player.
The same is also true for the reverse: a high tackle percentage paired with a low DATE suggests a player who feeds off of easy tackles and weak opponents, and is therefore overvalued.
Scouting departments and management thus use DATE to more accurately value defensive players, potentially scoring them a diamond in the rough or avoiding an overpriced free agent.

OATE has a similar use case.
A player with high OATE and Forced Missed Tackle volume or percent again suggests an elite player, while high DATE and low FMT volume suggest an underutilized one.
Again, a high OATE and low FMT% suggest a player is competing against unusually elite tacklers, and could be undervalued, and vice versa.
